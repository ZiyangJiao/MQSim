Note: In the simulator, "OP" is equvalent with the term "S_f" in the paper.
In Simulater: Overprovisioning_Ratio: the ratio of reserved storage space with respect to the available flash storage capacity. Range = {all positive double precision values}.
In Paper: spare factor S_f = (T - U) / T

According to the paper: S_f = 0.07, A should be 7.318 (Uniform workload, FIFO GC)
